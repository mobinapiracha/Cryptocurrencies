# Cryptocurrencies

In this analysis, we used the power of unsupervised learning to cluster cryptocurrencies in order to select the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. We first filtered our crytocurrencies dataset to only include currencies being currently traded, we dropped unnecessary columns, only included cryptocurrencies that are are mined, created dummy variables for our categories and scaled our data. We them, employed the principal components analysis for dimensionality reduction to reduce our dimensions to just 3 components. We created an elbow curve to find the ideal number of clusters which in our case were 4 clusters, and we finally clustered our data. Finally, we visualized our data with a 3D plot showing a 3 dimensional view of our 3 components with color representing our Cluster Class. We also leveraged Min Max Scaler to scale our Total Coins Mined and Total Coins Supplied in order to create a scatterplot showing our coins mined and supplied by their Cluster Class. This analysis helps us narrow down our search for the best cryptocurrencies to invest in by clustering by features that allow us to distinguish good cryptocurrencies from bad ones.
